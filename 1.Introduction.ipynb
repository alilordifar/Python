    "# What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted scripting language developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. The initial version was published at the alt.sources newsgroup in 1991, and version 1.0 was released in 1994.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.0 was released in 2000, and the 2.x versions were the prevalent releases until December 2008. At that time, the development team made the decision to release version 3.0, which contained a few relatively small but significant changes that were not backward compatible with the 2.x versions. Python 2 and 3 are very similar, and some features of Python 3 have been backported to Python 2. But in general, they remain not quite compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Python 2 and 3 have continued to be maintained and developed, with periodic release updates for both. As of this writing, the most recent versions available are 2.7.15 and 3.6.5. However, an official End Of Life date of January 1, 2020 has been established for Python 2, after which time it will no longer be maintained. If you are a newcomer to Python, it is recommended that you focus on Python 3, as this tutorial will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is still maintained by a core development team at the Institute, and Guido is still in charge, having been given the title of BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) by the Python community. The name Python, by the way, derives not from the snake, but from the British comedy troupe Monty Python’s Flying Circus, of which Guido was, and presumably still is, a fan. It is common to find references to Monty Python sketches and movies scattered throughout the Python documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Python is Popular\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been growing in popularity over the last few years. The 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey ranked Python as the 7th most popular and the number one most wanted technology of the year. World-class software development companies around the globe use Python every single day.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to research by Dice Python is also one of the hottest skills to have and the most popular programming language in the world based on the Popularity of Programming Language Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the popularity and widespread use of Python as a programming language, Python developers are sought after and paid well. If you’d like to dig deeper into Python salary statistics and job opportunities, you can do so here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Python is Interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages are compiled, meaning the source code you create needs to be translated into machine code, the language of your computer’s processor, before it can be run. Programs written in an interpreted language are passed straight to an interpreter that runs them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes for a quicker development cycle because you just type in your code and run it, without the intermediate compilation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential downside to interpreted languages is execution speed. Programs that are compiled into the native language of the computer processor tend to run more quickly than interpreted programs. For some applications that are particularly computationally intensive, like graphics processing or intense number crunching, this can be limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, for most programs, the difference in execution speed is measured in milliseconds, or seconds at most, and not appreciably noticeable to a human user. The expediency of coding in an interpreted language is typically worth it for most applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Python is Free\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is developed under an OSI-approved open-source license, making it free to install, use, and distribute, even for commercial purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A version of the interpreter is available for virtually any platform there is, including all flavors of Unix, Windows, macOS, smartphones and tablets, and probably anything else you ever heard of. A version even exists for the half dozen people remaining who use OS/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Python is Portable\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python code is interpreted and not compiled into native machine instructions, code written for one platform will work on any other platform that has the Python interpreter installed. (This is true of any interpreted language, not just Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Python is Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "As programming languages go, Python is relatively uncluttered, and the developers have deliberately kept it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rough estimate of the complexity of a language can be gleaned from the number of keywords or reserved words in the language. These are words that are reserved for special meaning by the compiler or interpreter because they designate specific built-in functionality of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 has 33 keywords, and Python 2 has 31. By contrast, C++ has 62, Java has 53, and Visual Basic has more than 120, though these latter examples probably vary somewhat by implementation or dialect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code has a simple and clean structure that is easy to learn and easy to read. In fact, as you will see, the language definition enforces code structure that is easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Python is General-purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language, so developer can do lots of things using Python. It has a variety of applications in different domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Automate Simple tasks.\n",
    " - Searching for file and editing them.\n",
    " - Scraping information from a website.\n",
    " - Reading and editing excel files.\n",
    " - Work with PDFs.\n",
    " - Automate emails and text messages.\n",
    " - Fill out Form.\n",
    "2) Data science and machine learning.\n",
    " - Analyze large data files.\n",
    " - Create visualizations.\n",
    " - Perform machine learning tasks.\n",
    " - Create and run predictive algorithms.\n",
    "3) Create websites.\n",
    " - Use web frameworks such as Django and Flask to handle the backend of a website and user data.\n",
    " - Create interactive dashboards for users."

    "# Anaconda and Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2011, Python has included pip, a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. However, for numerical computations, there are several dependencies that are not written in Python, so the initial releases of pip could not solve the problem by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To circumvent this problem, Continuum Analytics released Anaconda, a Python distribution focused on scientific applications and Conda, a package and environment management system, which is used by the Anaconda distribution. It’s worth noticing that the more recent versions of pip can handle external dependencies using wheels, but, by using Anaconda, you’ll be able to install critical libraries for data science more smoothly. (You can read more on this discussion here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Conda is tightly coupled to the Anaconda Python Distribution, the two are distinct projects with different goals:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Anaconda** is a full distribution of the software in the PyData ecosystem, including Python itself along with binaries for several third-party open-source projects. Besides Anaconda, there’s also Miniconda, which is a minimal Python distribution including basically Conda and its dependencies so that you can install only the packages you need, from scratch\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Conda** is a package, dependency, and environment management system that could be installed without the Anaconda or Miniconda distribution. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux and was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language. The main purpose is to solve external dependencies issues in an easy way, by downloading pre-compiled versions of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **PIP:** pip is the package installer for Python. You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes. It stands for *Preferred Installer Program*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, it is more like a cross-platform version of a general purpose package manager such as APT) or YUM), which helps to find and install packages in a language-agnostic way. Also, Conda is an environment manager, so if you need a package that requires a different version of Python, by using Conda, it is possible to set up a separate environment with a totally different version of Python, maintaining your usual version of Python on your default environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a lot of discussion regarding the creation of another package management system for the Python ecosystem. It’s worth mentioning that Conda’s creators pushed Python standard packaging to the limit and only created a second tool when it was clear that it was the only reasonable way forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda and Miniconda have become the most popular Python distributions, widely used for data science and machine learning in various companies and research laboratories. They are free and open source projects and currently include 1400+ packages in the repository. In the following section, we’ll go through the installation of the Miniconda Python distribution on a Windows machine."

    "\n",
    "When you start developing a project from scratch, it’s recommended that you use the latest versions of the libraries you need. However, when working with someone else’s project, such as when running an example from Kaggle or Github, you may need to install specific versions of packages or even another version of Python due to compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem may also occur when you try to run an application you’ve developed long ago, which uses a particular library version that does not work with your application anymore due to updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are a solution to this kind of problem. By using them, it is possible to create multiple environments, each one with different versions of packages. A typical Python set up includes Virtualenv, a tool to create isolated Python virtual environments, widely used in the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda includes its own environment manager and presents some advantages over Virtualenv, especially concerning numerical applications, such as the ability to manage non-Python dependencies and the ability to manage different versions of Python, which is not possible with Virtualenv. Besides that, Conda environments are entirely compatible with default Python packages that may be installed using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda installation provides Conda and a root environment with a version of Python and some basic packages installed. Besides this root environment, it is possible to set up additional environments including different versions of Python and packages.\n",
